        <h1>Welcome to Mushroom Recognizer</h1>
        <p>
            This is a web application designed to help you identify various species of mushrooms using a machine learning model. 
            The model is trained to recognize the following species: 
            Agaricus, Amanita, Boletus, Cortinarius, Entoloma, Hygrocybe, Lactarius, Russula, and Suillus. 
            Simply upload an image of a mushroom, and the model will predict the species for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mushroom Model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the visual 
            features of mushrooms and accurately classify them into one of the nine species. 
            This tool is perfect for mushroom enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone interested in mycology.
